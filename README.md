# xStream - Pay-Per-Second Video Monetization Platform

> **Revolutionary Web3 streaming platform enabling precise pay-per-second video monetization with x402 micropayments on Base blockchain**

xStream transforms video monetization by introducing real-time, usage-based payments. Viewers pay only for the exact seconds they watch, while creators receive instant compensation with unprecedented precision.
